## Introduction
During winter semester of academic year 2019/2020 each member of our group was studying at Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid through the Erasmus program. We had different choices for Erasmus destination but finally have met here in Madrid. Since we all had different reasons for applying to this University and choosing this city, we wanted to explore student's choices for Erasmus and their destinations. After searching the internet for some time we found out that European union publishes data including information about every student's exchange. Considering that this exchange is something we all have in common, we have decided to explore one of these datasets. The most interesting question that occurred to us is: What is the most popular city or university for students in our area of study? Then we can compare it to our own choice. We can also see how many people from our countries actually had the same choice as we did.
